# Getting started — install Kocoa Beam and set up your first printer

**Languages: [English](getting-started.md) · [Português (BR)](pt-br/getting-started.md) · [简体中文](zh-Hans/getting-started.md)**

A step-by-step guide for people who have never done this before. The example
is an **Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro**, but the same steps work for any printer that
already runs Klipper firmware.

> The screenshots were taken on a Samsung Galaxy S10+ (Android 12) and the
> Fluidd/Mainsail pages in Chrome. Your phone may look a little different
> (especially the Android install screens), but the order of the steps is the
> same. Fluidd shows its messages in your browser's language.

## What you need

- An Android phone or tablet (Android 5.0 or newer) that will stay plugged in
  next to the printer.
- A **USB OTG cable/adapter** to connect the printer to the phone.
- A printer that already runs **Klipper firmware** (if yours does not, see
  [build-firmware.md](build-firmware.md)).
- The phone and the computer you will use to open the web page must be on the
  **same Wi‑Fi network**.

## 1. Download the right APK

Download the `.apk` from the project's **Releases** page. There are three
versions — pick the one that matches your phone's processor:

| APK | Use it on |
|---|---|
| `arm64` | Most phones from about 2017 on (64‑bit) |
| `armv7` | Older phones and tablets (32‑bit) — **if you are not sure, choose this one**, it also runs on 64‑bit phones |
| `amd64` | Emulators and Intel/AMD Android devices |

## 2. Install the APK

1. Open your phone's **Files** (or **My Files**) app and go to **Downloads**.
2. Tap the APK file.

3. Android asks if you want to install the app. Tap **Install**. (If it says
   installing from this source is blocked, tap **Settings** and allow it for
   your Files app, then go back.)

4. Google Play Protect may say the app was not scanned, because it does not
   come from the Play Store. Tap **More details**, then **Install without
   scanning**.

5. Wait for **Installing…** to finish, then tap **Open**.

> If "Installing…" stays on screen for several minutes, cancel it and try
> again — Play Protect is sometimes slow to answer.

## 3. First launch: battery settings

The app has to keep running in the background while it prints. On the first
screen switch on both options and tap **Next**; when Android asks to stop
battery optimization for Kocoa Beam, tap **Allow**.

You land on the main screen. It is empty until you add a printer. (You can
change the app language any time in **Settings → App language**.)

## 4. Add your printer

1. Tap the big **+** button at the bottom.
2. **Name** — anything you like, for example `Neptune 3 Pro`.
3. **Config** — tap it and pick the starting configuration for your printer
   model. The list is long and sorted by name; models start with `printer-`
   followed by the brand. For the Neptune 3 Pro, choose
   `printer-elegoo-neptune3-pro-2023.cfg`. If your model is not listed, pick
   `example-cartesian.cfg` and edit it later (see step 7).
4. **Autostart** — switch it on if you want this printer to start by itself
   whenever the app opens.
5. Tap **Create**.

Your printer now appears under **Instances**, marked **Idle**.

## 5. Start it and allow USB access

1. Plug the printer into the phone with the OTG cable.
2. Tap the **▶ play** button (the big one at the bottom starts every printer;
   the small one on the card starts just that printer).
3. Android asks **"Allow Kocoa Beam to access USB Serial?"** — tick
   **Always open Kocoa Beam when USB Serial is connected** and tap **OK**.

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/16-usb-permission.png" alt="USB permission prompt" width="288"></p>

> Missed the question, or tapped Cancel? Fully close the app and open it again
> — the question comes back. If the printer shows **MCU error during connect**
> in Fluidd/Mainsail, this is almost always the reason.

The card changes to **Running** and the address of the web page appears at
the top. Mainsail is `http://<phone-IP>:4409/` and Fluidd is
`http://<phone-IP>:4408/`.

## 6. Open Fluidd or Mainsail

On a computer or another phone on the same Wi‑Fi, open the address shown in
the app. To switch between the two interfaces go to **Settings → Web
frontend** and tap the tile.

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/17-settings-frontend.png" alt="Settings: Web frontend tile" width="288"></p>

## 7. Fix the "missing configuration" warnings

The first time, both interfaces will complain that a few standard printer
features are missing from `printer.cfg` (pause/resume, cancel print, …). This
is normal — add them once and it is done.

**Mainsail** shows an orange **Missing configuration** box:

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/20-mainsail-missing-config.png" alt="Mainsail missing configuration" width="720"></p>

**Fluidd** shows a **warnings** box with the same items:

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/30-fluidd-missing-config.png" alt="Fluidd warnings" width="720"></p>

### The lines to add

Add this block to the top of `printer.cfg` (any place outside another
section works). **The two-space indentation on the lines under `gcode:` is
required.**

```ini
[pause_resume]

[display_status]

[gcode_macro CANCEL_PRINT]
description: Cancel the actual running print
rename_existing: CANCEL_PRINT_BASE
gcode:
  TURN_OFF_HEATERS
  CANCEL_PRINT_BASE

[gcode_macro PAUSE]
rename_existing: PAUSE_BASE
gcode:
  PAUSE_BASE

[gcode_macro RESUME]
rename_existing: RESUME_BASE
gcode:
  RESUME_BASE
```

### In Mainsail

1. Click **MACHINE** in the left menu.
2. In **Config Files**, click **printer.cfg**.

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/21-mainsail-machine-page.png" alt="Mainsail Machine page" width="720"></p>

3. The editor opens. Click on an empty line near the top and paste the block.
4. Click **SAVE & RESTART** (top right).

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/22-mainsail-printer-cfg-editor.png" alt="Mainsail editor before" width="720"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/23-mainsail-cfg-added-lines.png" alt="Mainsail editor with the block pasted" width="720"></p>

After the restart the orange box is gone:

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/24-mainsail-after-restart.png" alt="Mainsail dashboard without warnings" width="720"></p>

### In Fluidd

1. Click the **{…} Configuration** icon in the left menu.
2. In **Configuration files**, click **printer.cfg**.

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/31-fluidd-configuration-page.png" alt="Fluidd configuration page" width="720"></p>

3. Click on an empty line near the top and paste the block. If you type it by
   hand instead of pasting, Fluidd's editor does **not** indent for you — the
   red lines in the editor mean the two spaces are missing.
4. Click **SAVE AND RESTART** in the top bar.

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/32-fluidd-printer-cfg-editor.png" alt="Fluidd editor before" width="720"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/33-fluidd-cfg-added-lines.png" alt="Fluidd editor with the block added" width="720"></p>

The warnings disappear and the **CANCEL_PRINT**, **PAUSE** and **RESUME**
buttons show up on the dashboard:

<p align="center"><img src="images/setup/34-fluidd-after-restart.png" alt="Fluidd dashboard after the fix" width="720"></p>

## 8. If Moonraker complains about `[virtual_sdcard]`

Kocoa Beam writes the `[virtual_sdcard]` section for you, with the correct
folder for each printer, near the bottom of `printer.cfg` (just above the
`#*# <--- SAVE_CONFIG --->` line). **Do not add your own.**

If a message like *"GCode path received from Klipper does not match expected
location"* still appears — usually after copying a `printer.cfg` from another
setup, or after recreating the printer — open `printer.cfg`, find
`[virtual_sdcard]` and set `path:` to **exactly** the path written in the
message (or delete your own copy of the section and restart, so the app writes
a fresh one). Then click **Save & Restart**.

## 9. Adjust the rest for your printer

The starting file is a generic preset. Check the `[mcu]`, pins, bed size
(`position_max`), `z_offset`, PID and mesh values against your printer, and
calibrate (PID, Z offset, bed mesh) before the first print. If your printer
does not run Klipper yet, see [build-firmware.md](build-firmware.md).
