# Using OctoEverywhere

**Languages: [English](octoeverywhere.md) · [Português (BR)](pt-br/octoeverywhere.md) · [简体中文](zh-Hans/octoeverywhere.md)**

[OctoEverywhere](https://octoeverywhere.com) gives you remote access to your
printer (webcam, status, control) from octoeverywhere.com or its mobile app,
without opening ports on your router. Kocoa Beam runs the real OctoEverywhere
Klipper/Moonraker companion, adapted to run on-device instead of the
systemd service it normally installs as — see
[whats-new.md](whats-new.md#octoeverywhere-remote-access) for the technical
summary.

## Enabling it

1. Start a printer profile (it has to be **running** — OctoEverywhere links
   to whichever profile is currently active).
2. Go to **Settings → Remote access** and turn on **Enable OctoEverywhere**.
3. Wait a few seconds for it to generate a printer ID, then tap **Link
   printer**. A QR code appears — scan it with your phone's camera (or open
   the link on the device itself) to finish linking it to your
   OctoEverywhere account, same as any other OctoEverywhere install.
   - If you see "Not ready yet", it just means the companion hasn't finished
     starting — wait a moment and tap **Link printer** again.
4. Once linked, your printer shows up at octoeverywhere.com and in the
   OctoEverywhere mobile app.
   - The companion only checks whether it's linked once, at connect time —
     it doesn't get a live update for a session that's already open. If
     "Go to Klipper" on octoeverywhere.com still says the printer isn't
     connected right after you finish linking, turn **Enable
     OctoEverywhere** off and back on once to force a reconnect.

## Webcam

OctoEverywhere finds its webcam feed the same way Fluidd/Mainsail do: through
Moonraker's own webcam list, not through anything Kocoa Beam registers
automatically. If you also want to stream your printer's camera through
OctoEverywhere:

1. Turn on **Settings → Camera → Enable camera server** (see
   [whats-new.md](whats-new.md#usb-webcam-support) — this also covers plugging
   in a USB webcam).
2. Add a webcam in Fluidd's or Mainsail's own camera settings, pointing at:
   - Stream URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8889/`
   - Snapshot URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8889/snapshot`
3. OctoEverywhere picks it up automatically the next time it refreshes its
   webcam list — no extra configuration on the OctoEverywhere side.

## Notes and limitations

- Only **one** printer profile can be linked at a time, even if you run
  several concurrently — OctoEverywhere follows whichever profile reached
  "running" first. Disable and re-enable after switching profiles to move it.
- OctoEverywhere's own crash telemetry (Sentry) is disabled by default; the
  actual remote-access connection to octoeverywhere.com is unaffected.
- This has not been hardware-tested end-to-end (i.e. an actual account
  linked and driven from octoeverywhere.com) — the companion runs and talks
  to Moonraker correctly, but please report any issues you hit while linking
  or using it remotely.

## Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: `octoeverywhere.log` lives alongside `klippy.log`/`moonraker.log`
  in that profile's `logs` folder — browse to it with a file manager app
  through Kocoa Beam's own storage entry (Android's Files app → "Kocoa Beam"),
  the same place you'd already look for Klipper/Moonraker logs.
- **Re-linking from scratch**: turn OctoEverywhere off, delete that profile's
  `octoeverywhere` folder from the app's private storage (not the public one
  above — a file manager with root, or `adb shell run-as`, is needed for
  this), then turn it back on to generate a fresh printer ID and link again.
  You can also just unlink/re-link the printer directly from your
  octoeverywhere.com account settings instead.
